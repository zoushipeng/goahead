## GoAhead 2.X License

GoAhead version 2.X is obsolete.  If you are using version 2, you cannot apply code or patches from the GoAhead version 4+ code base as the GoAhead 2.X license is incompatible. You must adopt a commercial license for GoAhead version 4+. You cannot extract patches from this repository and apply to GoAhead 2 code.

While the GoAhead 3/4+ APIs are different in syntax, the underlying functionality is the same, the upgrade to version 4+ is quite easy.
