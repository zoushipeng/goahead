### Documentation

  See https://www.embedthis.com/goahead/doc/index.html.

### Building from Source

You can build GoAhead with make, Visual Studio, Xcode or [MakeMe](https://www.embedthis.com/makeme/).

The IDE projects and Makefiles will build with SSL using the [MbedTLS](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbedtls) TLS stack. To build with CGI, OpenSSL or other modules, read the [projects/README.md](projects/README.md) for details.

### To Build with Make

#### Linux or MacOS

    make

or to see the commands as they are invoked:

    make SHOW=1

You can pass make variables to tailor the build. For a list of variables:

	make help

To run

	make run

#### Windows

    make

The make.bat script runs projects/windows.bat to locate the Visual Studio compiler. If you have setup
your CMD environment for Visual Studio by running the Visual Studio vsvarsall.bat, then that edition of
Visual Studio will be used. If not, windows.bat will attempt to locate the most recent Visual Studio version.

Before leaving this dialog, set the debugger options by selecting "Run/Debug" on the left hand side.
