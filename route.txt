#   route.txt - Route and authorization configuration
#
#   User and role definitions are stored in auth.txt

#   Schema
#       user name=NAME password=PASSWORD roles=ROLES
#       role name=NAME abilities=ABILITIES
#       route uri=URI protocol=PROTOCOL methods=METHODS handler=HANDLER redirect=STATUS@URI \
#           extensions=EXTENSIONS abilities=ABILITIES 
#
#   Routes may require authentication and that users possess certain abilities.
#   The abilities, extensions, methods and redirect keywords use comma separated tokens to express a set of 
#       required options, or use "|" separated tokens for a set of alternative options. This implements AND/OR.
#   The protocol keyword may be set to http or https. The redirect status may be "*" to match all HTTP status codes.
#   Multiple redirect fields are permissable
#
#   Examples:
#
#   Universally redirect http to https for secure communications
#       route uri=/ protocol=http redirect=*@https handler=redirect
#
#   Require TLS to access anything under /secure
#       route uri=/secure/ protocol=https
#
#   Define roles
#       role name=manager abilities=view,edit,delete
#
#   Define a user
#       user name=joshua password=2fd6e47ff9bb70c0465fd2f5c8e5305e roles=manager,purchaser
