exp-less
===

Expansive plugin for Less files.

## Overview

The exp-less plugin provides build tooling for stylesheets. It provides the **less** service to compile less stylesheets into CSS stylesheets.

A map of file dependencies may be defined so that a master Less stylesheet will be rebuilt
by Expansive whenever an include stylesheet is updated. 

## Installation

    pak install exp-less

## Services

Provides the following services:

* less

## less

The less service processes LESS stylesheets using the **lessc** utility into CSS stylesheets.

By convention, exp-less expects master Less stylesheets to be named with a '.css.less' extension and included Less 
files to use a simple '.less' extension. 

### Configuration

* enable &mdash; Enable the less service to process less files. Defaults to true.
* files &mdash; Array of file patterns of stylesheets to compile. Defaults to [ '**.less', '!**.css.less' ] which 
    selects all files with a '.less' extension and omits those with a '.css.less' extension.
* stylesheets &mdash; Stylesheets to update if any less file changes.
    If specified, the "dependencies" map will be automatically created. Defaults to 'css/all.css'.
* dependencies &mdash; Explicit map of dependencies if not using "stylesheet". They property name is the master LESS
    stylesheet and the value contains the ingredient less stylesheets that are included by the master.

            dependencies: { 
                'css/all.css.less' : '**.less'
