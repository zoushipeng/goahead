<B>NAME</B>
       webcomp - Compile files into C source code

<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
       <B>webcomp [options] files ... &gtoutput.c</B>

       [<I>--files fileList</I>] [<I>--name structName</I>] [<I>--prefix prefix</I>]

<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
       To  enable files to be accessed on embedded systems without a file sys-
       tem, the <B>webcomp </B>command converts arbitrary files into C code that  can
       be  compiled and linked into a program. This is useful for applications
       that must execute completely from ROM and not  access  a  file  system.
       This  facility can also enhance security by preventing the modification
       of files.

       The MPR portable runtime provides routines which can  then  read  these
       files much as you would read any file on disk.

<B>OPTIONS</B>
       <B>--files fileList</B>
              Option to provide a list of files that should be converted.  <B>--p</B>
              <B>prefix </B>Specifies a prefix to remove from each  of  the  compiled
              file names.

       <B>--name structName</B>
              Specifies  the name of top level C structure that holds the con-
              verted files.

       <B>--prefix prefix</B>
              Specifies a leading file name prefix to  remove  from  the  file
              names.

<B>EXAMPLE</B>
       This  example  will  create  a list of web files and then convert these
       files into C structures in the file romFiles.c.

           find web -type f -print &gtfileList

           webcomp --files filelist &gtromFiles.c

           cc -o romFiles.o romFiles.c
