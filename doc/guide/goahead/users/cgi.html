            <h1>Using CGI</h1>
            <p>The Common Gateway Interface (CGI) was originally developed as part of the NCSA HTTP server and is an
            old standard for interfacing external applications with HTTP servers. It still enjoys considerable use.</p>
            <p>CGI was created to allow dynamic data to be generated in response to HTTP requests and return the
            results to the clients's browser. Plain HTML documents are typically static, while a CGI program allows the
            response data to be dynamically created.</p>
            <p>However, since CGI was first developed, several better means of creating dynamic web pages have been
            created that are faster and more efficient. Read more about such replacements in <a href=
            "frameworks.html">Web Frameworks</a>, <a href="ejs.html">Using Ejscript</a> and <a href="php.html">Using
            PHP</a>.</p>
            <p>Embedthis GoAhead supports CGI so that existing CGI applications can be fully supported. GoAhead has a
            high-performance and fully featured CGI Handler that alleviates many of the pains with configuring CGI
            setup.</p><a id="configuringCgi"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Configuring CGI Programs</h2>
            <p>Requests for CGI programs may be configured in two primary ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>By URI prefix</li>
                <li>By extension</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When invoked by URI prefix, the CGI programs and scripts are stored in special CGI directories (for
            example "cgi-bin"). When invoked by URI extension, the CGI programs may be stored anywhere in the web
            directory.</p>
            <p>For security, it is usually best to store all CGI programs and scripts outside the directory containing
            the web content. Consequently, invoking CGI programs by extension should only be used in combination with a
            URI prefix that allows the CGI directory to be specified.</p>
            <h3>Invoking by URI Prefix</h3>
            <p>GoAhead nominates a directory as a CGI directory via the <a href=
            "dir/server.html#scriptAlias">ScriptAlias</a> configuration file directive. For example:</p>
<pre>
ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ $SERVER_ROOT/cgi-bin/ 
</pre>
            <p>The ScriptAlias directive above is short hand for:
<pre>
&lt;Route /cgi-bin/&gt;
    DocumentRoot $SERVER_ROOT/cgi-bin/
    SetHandler cgiHandler
    Target run
&lt;/Route&gt;
</pre>
            <p>When a URI is requested by a browser that includes the "<em>/cgi-bin/</em>" prefix, the 
            script name immediately after "/cgi-bin/" will be run. For example:</p>
<pre>
http://www.embedthis.com/cgi-bin/testCgi
</pre>
            <h3>Invoking by URI Extension</h3>
            <p>To configure GoAhead to run CGI programs based on the URI extension use the <a href=
            "dir/route.html#addHandler">AddHandler</a> configuration file directive. For example:</p>
            <pre>
AddHandler cgiHandler .myExt
</pre>
            <p>This configures GoAhead to pass URIs that contain the ".myExt extension to the CGI handler.</p>
            <h4>Mime Types and Action Programs</h4>
            <p>To determine which program the CGI handler should run, the CGI handler looks up the mime type associated
            with the ".myExt" extension. Mime types are read by GoAhead from the "mime.types" file at startup. This file
            maps extensions to mime types. This is an example line from the "mime.types" file:</p>
            <pre>
application/x-goahead-perl myExt
</pre>
            <p>This maps the ".myExt" extension to the perl mime type. This mime type must then be mapped to a program
            via the the <a href="dir/server.html#action">Action</a> directive. For example:</p>
            <pre>
Action application/x-goahead-perl /usr/bin/perl
</pre>
            <p>This will cause /usr/bin/perl to be run to process the request. Output from perl is captured by the CGI
            handler and then returned to the user's browser.</p><a id="invoking"></a>
            <h2 class="section">Invoking CGI Programs</h2>
            <p>When a CGI program is run, the GoAhead CGI handler communicates request information to the CGI program
            via Environment Variables and in some cases, via the command line.</p>
            <h3>CGI Command Line</h3>
            <p>The command line will be set differently depending on how the CGI program is being invoked. There are
            four possible scenarios:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Program invoked directly via the request URI.</li>
                <li>Program invoked indirectly if the CGI script contains a Bang path directive.</li>
                <li>The program is specified via an ActionProgram directive in the GoAhead configuration file.</li>
                <li>On Windows if the program is a Windows Batch file</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The command line arguments for the CGI program will be set differently in each case. See the tables
            below for the specifications as to how the command line arguments are defined:</p>
            <h4>Programs Invoked Directly via the Request URI</h4>
            <table title="args">

            </table>
            <h4>Programs Invoked Indirectly with Bang Directive</h4>
            <p>If the CGI program/script specified in the URI contains a "#!/pathToProgram" directive on the first
            line, it is interpreted to be the path to the real CGI program to run. The script name is then passed in
            the command line.</p>

            <h3>URI Encoding</h3>
            <p>When a URI is sent via HTTP, certain special characters must be escaped so the URI can be processed
            unambiguously by the server. To escape the special characters, the HTTP client should convert them to their
            %hex equivalent. Form and query variables are separated by "&amp;". For example: a=1&amp;b=2 defines two
            form variables "a" and "b" with their values equal to "1" and "2" respectively.</p><a id="cgiProgramming"></a>
            <h2 class="section">CGI Programming</h2>
            <p>CGI program can return almost any possible content type back to the client's browser: plain HTML, audio,
            video or any other format. CGI programs can also control the user's browser and redirect it to another URI.
            To do this, CGI programs return pseudo-HTTP headers that are interpreted by GoAhead before passing the data
            on to the client.</p>
            <p>GoAhead understands the following CGI headers that can be output by the CGI program. They are
            case-insensitive.</p>

            <p>If you have special data or environment variables that must be passed to your CGI program, you can wrap
